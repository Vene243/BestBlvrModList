<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962">HugsLib</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>HugsLib is a library that provides shared functionality to other mods.<br />
Version: 9.0.1</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552">Hospitality</a> by Orion</h5>

<p>Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. <br />
You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.<br />
Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.<br />
So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. I also need a log. You create it by pressing Ctrl-F12 after you get an error or the problem first occurs. You'll get a link that you can post with your description. <br />
Hospitality should be loaded as late as possible in the load order.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1446523594">Dubs Mint Menus</a> by Dubwise</h5>

<p>Adds new list boxes for recipe bills, health bills, plant selection, architect menu, research menu, and a quick select menu for designators, making it easier to find things when lots of mods are running.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485">Allow Tool</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 3.11.1<br />
A set of tools to make your life on the Rim a bit easier.<br />
Easily forbid and unforbid items, select similar things, have things hauled urgently and affect the entire map with powerful new tool extensions.<br />
All tools are found in the Architect > Orders menu. Right-click tools with the small mouse icon to access their special context actions.<br />
Pressing the Context Action key ("Equals" by default) will activate the first right-click menu action of the tool you are holding. <br />
All tools are accessible from anywhere by pressing their shortcut key without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=872762753">MinifyEverything</a> by erdelf</h5>

<p>You want to minify every building ? Well then you came to the right place <br />
This mod searches the entire database of buildings and adds the minifiable feature to it.<br />
Should work with pretty much every mod.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761315214">Map Reroll</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 2.7.1<br />
<size=20>Description</size><br />
Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.<br />
Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.<br />
<size=20>How to use</size><br />
Start a new game, or settle a new map. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.<br />
Use "Reroll Map" to pick a new map from a list of previews, or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.<br />
Each page of previews and geyser reroll operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.<br />
The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options > Mod Settings menu.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896">LWM's Deep Storage</a> by Little White Mouse</h5>

<p>Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution<br />
LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!<br />
ADDON MODS:<br />
* Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:<br />
* A (faster?) UI for right-clicking on things: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018<br />
* Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!<br />
FAQ / "I have a problem":<br />
* Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!<br />
* These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric<br />
* Does it work with Vanilla shelves?<br />
* You can always add more stored things in Mod Settings<br />
<em>* (A little walkthrough for doing that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187075071)<br />
Want to say Thanks?<br />
* Have *</em> in Art?  Draw me a picture of a little white mouse!  I'm reachable on the Ludeon forum.<br />
* Have extra spending money?  Share a cup of something tasty (some places around here deliver!) at https://ko-fi.com/littlewhitemouse<br />
Notes:<br />
* Storing things properly takes time - the colonists must carefully organize everything so it's easy to find what's needed.(<em>)<br />
* Animals cannot by default haul to Storage - their little brains and paws (claws, etc) cannot manage the clasps, locks, catches, etc required to store things properly.(</em>)<br />
* All the units you can build are in the Storage menu - by default this includes other mods' storage buildings.(<em>)<br />
* (</em>) - these can be changed in the Mod Settings (again, link above)<br />
Compatibility:<br />
* Storage compatible with many different mods: Dubs Bad Hygiene, RimCuisine, Survival Tools, Vegetable Garden.  If you see something that SHOULD be stored but isn't?  You can let me know!<br />
* You can also change what's allowed in the Mod Settings!<br />
* Plays well with mods that change stack size (OgreStack, Deep Stack, etc).  Want 10 stacks of 1000 Advanced Components in one square?  Go for it!  (Just watch out for mortar attacks...)<br />
* Plays well with mods that affect storage: Restricted Storage (LWM), Satisfied Storage, RimWorld Search Agency (not as well as Satisfied Storage), Stockpile for Disaster, heck - there's a Deep Refrigerator if you play with RimFridge<br />
* Plays well with mods that affect hauling: CommonSense, Pick Up and Haul.<br />
* Haul To Stack?  I have conflicting reports, let me know.<br />
* Other storage mods? maybe:<br />
<em>* Project RimFactory: probably okay, should be fully compatible soon<br />
*</em> Extended Storage: maybe<br />
** Other storage mod???  If you get weird behavior, turn off "Over Capacity" check in mod settings<br />
* Industrial Rollers: not fully, but fix is coming!<br />
Want more types of units?  Frozen organ storage?  Piggy banks for silver?  Cubbyholes for bedrolls?  You can either make your own derived mod (the XML is a mess, but it's a documented mess, and it's easy enough to follow!) or you can suggest things to me and offer to acquire a graphic (draw it yourself, find a free one, make deals with demons, whatever).<br />
Translations:<br />
Русский - Тхакиро<br />
Deutsch - Erdnussbrot<br />
Chinese Traditional - shiuanyue<br />
Note on Translations: These may not be complete translations, as I do add things from time to time. Want to translate it (all or part) into your language?  Great!  Let me know, I'll add it to the mod (or do a Pull Request on GitHub, if you do that thing - that is easiest for me!)<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013">Vanilla Expanded Framework</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan,  Orion,  Kikohi,  Taranchuk,  Sarg Bjornson,  Erdelf</h5>

<p>Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.<br />
Orion's Faction Discovery?<br />
Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888705256">Vanilla Hair Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan,  erdelf</h5>

<p>We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.<br />
We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!<br />
And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1938420742">Vanilla Events Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Kikohi,  Helixien</h5>

<p>Vanilla Events Expanded adds several new events to the game, all in line with vanilla events - nothing too drastic. A new tier of events is added - Purple events. Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718191613">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical Module</a> by OskarPotocki,  Atlas,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical module adds several new pieces of furniture to allow players for higher variety of medical beds and linkables. Sterile walls have also been added with color-coded line markings, allowing users to color-code the rooms.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814383360">Vanilla Weapons Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Trunken,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.<br />
Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2028381079">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer Module</a> by OskarPotocki,  Atlas,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer module adds several new pieces of furniture to allow players to witness better technological progress in regards to comfort and utility furniture. Repair shelves, Biolab sunlamps and reinforced walls will spice your colony up, whilst illuminated dressers and end tables as well as advanced beds will provide your pawns with highest possible comfort silver can buy.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1957158779">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming</a> by Oskar Potocki,  dninemfive,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.<br />
A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe it’s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!<br />
New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1968134023">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art module is something long overdue. Being an artist, I struggled to comprehend why the only type of sculptures we can make are small, large or grand artworks on a tiny pedestal. It made Artistic skill pretty much undesirable. Come on, how many times have you said to yourself “Oh crikey, that’s another pawn that can only do art”? <br />
A lot of people requested this mod on my Patreon so it’s about time I deliver. With this mod, your colony can create simple pottery from neolithic times, allowing you to gain some silver on the side to kickstart your base into the medieval era. Several new pieces of sculptures are available by the likes of small, large and grand statues, wall reliefs, decorative pillars and plinths that act both as an artwork and a shelf.<br />
With industrial era your colony will be able to produce beautiful embroidered rugs to decorate those ugly floors! A new type of wall - wallpaper - is now also available, allowing you to put some colour onto your grim, broken walls. Spacer era features a new type of art called a hologram, emitting beautiful shade of blue light and using intellectual skill to determine the quality of it - however it does use up power!<br />
And if that isn’t enough, a new type of quest reward is available - Archotech sculptures, not only being extremely beautiful and desirable, but also imprinting stunning imagery in the minds of surrounding colonists!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914064942">Vanilla Fishing Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.<br />
With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.<br />
<size=24>Compatibility</size><br />
Compatible with any other fishing mod<br />
Compatible with Advanced Biomes<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1906780517">Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw is an addition to a popular Vanilla Expanded mod series, adding four new quickdraw weapons. These firearms allow you to quickly respond to sudden enemy encounters, as special plasteel alloys allow you to reduce the aiming time to zero. There are drawbacks however - whilst these weapons fire a little bit faster than their vanilla counterparts, the cooldown after firing the shots is slightly increased.<br />
Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907283935">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tropical Swamp</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Tropical swamp never really had this “oh, this zone is dangerous” feel. It felt just like any other swamp. This very module, albeit only adding 3 new animals, is our way to remedy this. Alligators and Anacondas will now actively hunt in the tropical swamp biome, and they are a force to be reckoned with. To ease things up, we have also added Indian elephants - smaller versions of their african counterparts, with no tusks that can be sold. They are significantly easier to hunt and tame, and are a useful pack animal.<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Swamp biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Swamp, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907283872">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tropical Rainforest</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>After having my first Spaceship launch in the tropical rainforest biome, I have noticed it actually didn’t feel as tropical as I would like it to feel. Monkeys, tortoises, an elephant here and there, it doesn’t really give away that unique, diverse environment vibe. Sarg and I have decided to expand on it with a range of new, unique animals, which include gorillas and mandrills - possibly the most “jungle” animals there are. It is absolutely possible to tame your own army of tigers and send them off to hunt down the enemies, just as it is possible to have a peaceful tapir farm on the outskirts of the jungle!<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Rainforest biome expansion. It adds 6 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Rainforest, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845154007">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Trunken,  XeoNovaDan</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. <br />
This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134308519">Vanilla Cooking Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson,  Chowder</h5>

<p>Vanilla Cooking Expanded is a core module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods work very well without it, Vanilla Cooking Expanded makes use of fish from Vanilla Fishing Expanded as well as plants from Vanilla Plants Expanded in order to provide users with a more in-depth cooking experience.<br />
Mechanics are simple and intuitive - keeping within the vanilla spirit without the unnecessary fluff and production chains. Your colonists will be able to cook up a variety of new meal types, make mood boosting desserts out of fruits, make filling grilled meals that lose the effect when frozen, create large bakes using flour or produce large quantities of soup through boiling ingredients for several days at a time. Using our new system, you can now transform animal milk into cheese inside a cheese press - and it gains quality, and with that - value, the longer it’s inside! Yes, alongside Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval you can now create a cheese and wine empire! Hopefully this will provide one more reason to keep livestock!<br />
Our systems are heavily moddable and support a variety of pre-existing mods. With Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids you can now transform insectoid milk into insectoid cheese, and thanks to Sarg Bjornson, you can now utilise 19 (!) types of milk from Alpha Animals, Genetic Rim (plus patches), RimBees and Forsakens: Fauna to create your cheese empire!<br />
New ways of preserving food in the form of canning and deep frying, as well as a brand new condiment system will allow you to create not-so-filling gourmet meals that apply long term effects to people who consume them.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2016436324">Vanilla Textures Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Helixien,  Erin,  Luizi,  ISOREX,  erdelf</h5>

<p>Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.<br />
This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.<br />
When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.<br />
We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!</p>

<p>No animal mod, or in this instance, mod series, can be complete without Lions. This mod, albeit being smaller to not overpopulate the desolate deserts of the planet, contains some of the most popular and requested - and dangerous - animals that can most often be found in the desert. With this particular mod you can hear hyena’s laughter echo through the night, train your own pack of lions, tackle a desert tortoise and die due to venom injected by the feared gila monster.<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Desert biome expansion. It adds 4 new animals that will spawn in the Desert, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895364585">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tundra</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Tundra biome always felt devoid of any actual unique animals. With this module, we have introduced Musk oxen and a moose - a beautiful symbol of Canada, which can be milked every couple of days just like an already existing in the game Elk. Porcupines are tiny rodents, similar in a lot of ways to Capybaras, with sharp quills used to repel predators. Beware of the Megawolverines though! They are genetically modified experiment out of control, by many described as just large balls of fur and claws. Taming one could be a challenge, but having one ready for combat is a huge advantage.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963681588">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Australia</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Australia is currently suffering a terrible crisis, and our team believes that we need to do everything in our power to spread the awareness. 24 people have died due to the insane bushfires so far - with three of them being volunteer firefighters. Over 6.3 million hectares of land have been burnt, leading to deaths of countless animals - some native only to the continent of Australia. You probably wonder how big is the 6.3 million hectares? Well, it’s essentially half of England. Please, consider donating to either NSW Rural Fire Service or WWF (both links will be available at the bottom of the mod description) to help save what little animals are still alive.<br />

<p>Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Cats and Dogs variant. This mod adds 21 new breeds of dogs and cats to perfectly fit vanilla game, with custom vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing. With this variant you are finally able to send your maine coons on the enemies, run a farm with an old german shepherd or run a dog show with all your sweet poodles.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1836900626">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Arid Shrubland</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>A giraffe is probably the most recognizable african animal. For some reason, it’s not in the vanilla base game, and your african tribe immersion is forever ruined. Crocodiles can never hunt you around the river bank, hippopotami can’t rip your arms off with a single bite and you can’t hear coyotes around the campfires. Except, now you can.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895364938">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Boreal Forest</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Boreal forest is a biome drastically needing some new, unique animals. With this module, you can see famous american black bears - smaller cousins of the grizzly bears, as well as arctic coyotes and tiny otters.<br />

<p>I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2493234474">Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations</a> by Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations is a standalone release in the Vanilla Textures Expanded series, aiming at providing a LOT of visual variety to your vanilla bases.<br />
So, what does it do? Basically, it provides building graphics variations for the majority of vanilla’s buildings. This means every time you build a chair, the chair will have a randomized graphics. Not only that, but you can also swap the graphic of the building on command, allowing you to mix and match styles to properly decorate your base.<br />
The mod includes more than 150 new random building graphics for 35 vanilla buildings.</p>

<p>Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded means to bring much more needed life to your pawns as well as the overall world map. This mod alters what pawns do in their spare time, adds some much needed content in regards to interactions that breathes fresh air into otherwise boring and stale game. Pawns now also have aspirations that can be fulfilled to gain powerful mood buffs, and the whole inspiration system is also changed.<br />
Each of the mechanics in this mod can be disabled in mod options.<br />
This mod adds following mechanics:<br />
- Memories<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880253632">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Trunken</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.<br />

- Kitchen Sink Cabinet<br />

<p>Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.<br />
Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?<br />
This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:<br />
Gas masks protecting from toxicity;<br />
Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;<br />
Doctor scrubs and Chef’s uniforms.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2296404655">Vanilla Traits Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk,  Chowder</h5>

<p>Have you ever thought about how base game traits become repetitive after a while? Are you tired of seeing pyromaniac or kind pawn over and over again? Are you perhaps considering pyromaniac to be an instant death sentence in your colony? If for any of these questions the answer was ‘aye’, then look no further.<br />
Vanilla Traits Expanded adds 55 new traits, some offering unique new game mechanics, some being quirky and enhancing the storytelling, and some being straight up stat upgrades. Traits’ commonality has been adjusted after weeks of testing, to make sure no powerful or annoying traits appear too often.<br />
Using our new mod options menu, you can now disable specific traits added by vanilla game or any of the mods you have. This doesn’t mean that the trait will be magically removed from the pawn, but it’s commonality will be reduced to 0, stopping it from ever appearing in the game again.<br />
I really hope you will enjoy the effect of our hard work! Let us know in the comments what you think works and what doesn’t!</p>

<p>After the success of our Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval, which was a faction mod closing the gap between tribal faction and outlander faction, we have begun work on another faction mod - this time adding frontier settlers, inspired by western films. The scope of this mod is quite similar to our Medieval mod, so you can expect it to be a well fitting mini-expansion.<br />
Thanks to Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers, you can experience the harsh reality of being a gang of bandits on the rimworld frontier. Settlements of this faction are built in the same way they were in frontier America - with a main road separating a town into two parts. Thanks to new outfits and headgear, as well as several new weapons, your colonists will be able to blend in perfectly alongside all those thugs and prospectors shooting each other on the streets and drinking chemshine - a new, highly volatile chemfuel distilled alcohol. A large amount of new chemfuel-themed structures allow you to witness the power of combustible fuel, making your bases look just like the wild west settlements! A new starting scenario allows you to play bandits, a faction hostile to every other civilisation on the planet, and with new world quests you can become a bounty hunter or a caravan raider! Sorry, no stagecoach robbery included!<br />
A new storyteller, Diego Dire, would like to tell you a story that begins with the blaze of glory. Not only will he provide you with more western-style events than regular, vanilla events, he will also scale backwards - meaning the beginning will be difficult, but it will slowly become more and more friendly. That is, of course, until Diego decides to start the cycle all over again, throwing the worst of the worst at you. Can you handle the challenge?<br />
With a native support for the other Vanilla Expanded mods, settlers will come equipped with Vanilla Apparel Expanded clothing, whilst thanks to Vanilla Weapons Expanded, bandits will start using lever action rifles and sawed-off shotguns!<br />
And watch out for drunk muffalos. Those beasts love chemshine!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730936602">Achtung!</a> by Andreas Pardeike</h5>

<p>Command your colonists like a boss!<br />
The Achtung! mod enhances how you control RimWorld. You will get more control on how to position your colonists and how they take job orders.<br />
In a nutshell you can:<br />
- position your drafted colonists along a line<br />
- move them in formation<br />
- give orders to multiple colonists at once<br />
- force jobs so they get uninterrupted attention<br />
- haul and repair outside allowed areas<br />
EXAMPLES<br />
(<em>) Save time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose "melee". Done.<br />
(</em>) In combat, position colonists equally spaced in door openings. Select multiple drafted colonists and with the right mouse button drag a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!<br />
(<em>) Fall back a few steps with a group of colonists? Easy. Select them and hold the configured key to move them relative to their current formation. You can even rotate the formation with the standard rotation keys.<br />
(</em>) Make sure that wall and the sandbags are build before the raid arrives. No cloudwatching or eating allowed! Use the [Force] button that Achtung! adds to all "Prioritize..." menus and you can be sure that all assigned work will be done.<br />
(<em>) Want one colonist harvest and another sow these three fields? Force them to their tasks and queue up non-adjacted fields by simply adding forced work on them (like ordinary jobs but without the shift key).<br />
(</em>) Treat all injured colonists in their beds? Select a doctor, choose "Prioritize tending... [Force]" and increase the search range so nearby patients will be included (you will see a small "!" on all forced job). Then focus on other important stuff because you can be sure it's done.<br />
The original three Achtung! commands "Clean Room", "Fight Fire" or "Sow Zone/Room" still exist because they do stuff a bit smarter than the build in prioritized work commands.<br />
SETTINGS<br />
Achtung uses the default way to access mod settings. There, you find switches to turn certain features on/off and you can change the default keys to your liking.<br />
ADDING AND REMOVING:<br />
Achtung can be added to any existing game. It usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will "clean" the save and remove the dependency.<br />

&amp;lt;size=28&amp;gt;Features&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Hunting jobs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
- Set a target for meat, and never worry about designating hunting manually again!<br />
- Set an area to clear of all predators - keep your home area safe!<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Forestry jobs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
- Set a target for wood, and never worry about designating lumber manually again!<br />
- Automatically clear wind turbine catchment areas to ensure they're working at maximum efficiency.<br />
- Set an area to clear of all vegetation - make sure there's no possible cover or retreat for any hostiles that dare attack you.<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Livestock jobs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
- Set a target for animals (for four separate age/sex combinations), and pawns will auto-butcher and/or tame to manage your herd.<br />
- Restrict animals to specific areas (for example to separate male/female animals and prevent breeding).<br />
- Auto-butcher, tame and train according to your specifications.<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Overview&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
- Clear overview of all jobs<br />
- Show stock and designated levels for the last day, month and year<br />
- Show pawns capable of a job, and set work status<br />
- Prioritize jobs, the manager will handle prioritizing jobs on worktables (however standard priority ordering across worktables still applies).<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Import &amp;amp; Export&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
== coming back soon(tm) ==<br />
&amp;lt;size=28&amp;gt;How does it work?&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
You can manually set jobs in the new Manager tab on the bottom of the screen. Once set, a colonist with the manager skill and worktype enabled will go to a manager station to figure out the best way to assign designations.<br />
Periodically, the manager will check if the assigned designations are still up-to-date, and make changes or delete designations where required. The manager will not touch designations that are set manually, nor will managers create jobs. You're still the overlord.<br />
In theory there is no real limit to the number of manager jobs that can be created.<br />
&amp;lt;size=28&amp;gt;Notes&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
- Requires a new save. Adds a worktype, which in my tests gave errors on old savegames. If you also have my Work Tab mod, you should be able to add this mod in an ongoing save.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116">Work Tab</a> by Fluffy</h5>

<p>Provides a vastly more customizable work tab.<br />
&amp;lt;size=24&amp;gt;Important&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
Work Tab completely takes over job priorities from the vanilla game. In order to support core functionalities and other mods, it intercepts calls to get/set priorities. However, when it is told to set priorities by other modded code that is not aware of the time schedule or detailed priorities, the priority will be set for the whole day, and/or for all workgivers in a worktype.<br />
&amp;lt;size=24&amp;gt;Features&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
Various usability extentions to the 'vanilla' work tab;<br />
- Work types can be expanded (by Ctrl+clicking the column header) to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type.<br />
- Time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allowing you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc.<br />
- Up to 9 priority levels (configurable in mod options)<br />
- Various small UX tweaks; scrolling to increase/decrease/toggle priorities, increase/decrease priorities for whole columns/rows (by holding shift and clicking/scrolling while hovering over the column header/pawn name respectively).<br />
- &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;All functions are detailed in the tooltips, take a moment to hover over and read them!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;<br />
&amp;lt;size=24&amp;gt;Known Issues&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
- &amp;lt;mspace&amp;gt;"Star Wars -- The Force"&amp;lt;/mspace&amp;gt; versions prior to 1.21.1 cause priorities to reset for force users. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THIS INCLUDES THE CURRENT STEAM VERSION OF STAR WARS -- THE FORCE!&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; (as of 25/3/20). There is an official update available by one of the collaborators on the mod on &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;GitHub&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.<br />
- &amp;lt;mspace&amp;gt;Better Pawn Control&amp;lt;/mspace&amp;gt; has added support for &amp;lt;mspace&amp;gt;Work Tab&amp;lt;/mspace&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;mspace&amp;gt;Animal Tab&amp;lt;/mspace&amp;gt;, but there currently (as of 27/7/21) still is an issue where work settings may reset.<br />
&amp;lt;size=24&amp;gt;Notes&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
With great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it's (usually) a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk!<br />
Finally, there will never be an 'autolabour' mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a 'bulletin board' of jobs that need doing), it's not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.<br />

<p>Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.<br />
Icons and Symbols module adds over 200 new icons for ideologies. Icons have been categorised based on their looks and utilise respective tags to make sure they only appear on specific ideologies - you should not encounter a Transhumanist domination ideology with a flower as their symbol.<br />

<p>Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.<br />
Relics and Artifacts module introduces over 40 new inert relics to join the small selection of relics in vanilla game. No longer you will be bound to have a mysterious cube, or an ark, or  a shard. We’ve added scrolls, statuettes, idols, sword shards, gauntlets, mechanoid heads, tech parts and many, many more.<br />
Furthermore, this mod adds patches to apparel, allowing it to also be a relic, because I got tired of seeing all the possible guns as relics, but not helmets, armors etc.<br />
This of course increases the list of possible relics with hundreds of new items, so we have overhauled the relic selection UI, and added a search bar so it’s easier to find what you want!<br />

No longer you will be limited by the selected few new headwraps and burkas for your Role generation - your leaders will now be able to wear amazing new headgear such as Horse mask or fez, while moralists will adorn themselves in rags, similar to those of typical monks.<br />
On top of that, Vanilla Apparel Expanded apparel is also patched with this mod, allowing it to be desired by ideologies or specific roles! Of course it doesn’t mean it’s random or anything, on the contrary, you can now expect that your shooting specialists might require military apparel, while medical specialists will want to wear medical scrubs.<br />

<p>Blueprints allow the quick construction of repetitive rooms/areas.<br />
&amp;lt;size=28&amp;gt;Features&amp;lt;/size&amp;gt;<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Create blueprint&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
Use the 'Create' designator to drag over an area with existing constructions. Floors, walls and furniture will all be designated, and included in the blueprint. once created, a popup will appear with a default name, giving you the option to set a more meaningful name.<br />
&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;NOTE: Only constructions owned by you will be included, use the 'Claim' order if necessary.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Place blueprint&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
Once you've created a blueprint, you can use the new button to place copies of that blueprint. Blueprints can be rotated as normal. With a blueprint selected, you'll see an outline of what will be build on the main view, and a list of items and total cost in the lower left info panel. In this panel, you can click on furniture and walls made of stuff to change what stuff should be used in their construction.<br />
&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;NOTE: You can shift-click with a designator selected to use the planning mode. In this case, any walls in the blueprint will be used to create a plan for your future rooms. This might be useful for mining out the required space.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;<br />
&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rename, import &amp;amp; export blueprints&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;<br />
Once you've created a blueprint, you can right click the blueprint button to rename, remove or export the blueprint. Exported blueprints will be saved in the same location as RimWorlds save games and config files, in a directory called "Blueprints". If a blueprint has been exported, an option to remove and delete the exported blueprint will also appear.<br />
You can import previously exported blueprints by right clicking the 'Create' button, and selecting the blueprint from the list of available blueprints.<br />
&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;NOTE: While you can import/export blueprints between games, be careful with doing so when a blueprint contains (modded) items that are not available in the current game. If you import a blueprint containing items that are unavailable, an error will pop up, and the offending item will be deleted from the blueprint. I've tried to make sure the rest of the blueprint is still usable, but your results may vary.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;</p>

Press the 'Home' key (default, can be changed with in-game keybinding settings) while any colonist, enemy, animal or item is selected, and the camera will follow them (including furniture and plants - but they tend to not move much). Alternatively, you can click with the middle mouse button on colonists in the Colonist Bar on top of the screen to toggle following.<br />

HOW TO USE EMITERS<br />
1. Research one of them and build<br />
2. Select and configure a recipe for this emiter<br />
3. If you selected a recipe that needs a 'Terraforming'-Area, then make a 'Terraforming'-Area/Zone in range of the emiter<br />
4. Watch the emiter working<br />
Hint: Replicator needs a Stockpile-Zone<br />
HOW TO ACTIVATE LAVA ANIMATION<br />
1. Needs a mod which have lava terrains. (Like: SZ</em>StonesAndTerrains or SZ_Terrains or Advanced Biomes)<br />
2. Research 'Tectonic Emiter' under 'Terraform' tab and build it<br />
3. Make sure you have some lava terrain on map<br />
4. Wait for the random tick to watch the animation<br />
Build more Tectonic-Emiter to trigger more animations.<br />
Configure your own lava under the mod options or let it as default.<br />
HOW TO FIX PROBLEMS WITH OLD SAVEGAMES<br />
1. Load the mods, which are marked for your savegame.<br />
2. Sometimes its enough to load the savegame, then let the time run for some seconds, save the game and reload again.<br />
3. Some errors can be fixed by removing/destroying all working tables and benches, then refer to 2.<br />
4. if you should have errors because of missing minified, then try to enable mod option 'force minified creation'.<br />

<p>Vanilla Plants Expanded is a core module in a plant-based in the new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. After hours of designing, testing and  designing again, Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder are proud to present this content pack to help you with your RimWorld farming simulator. This mod features a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.<br />
Adding a variety of crops, each with different mechanics and traits, but still kept within vanilla balancing, we are hoping to give you a chance to tailor your farming industry to your liking. These plants are not meant to replace vanilla plants - they are balanced in-line with those, meaning rice and potatoes will still be useful!<br />
Fruit trees are biome-locked to two unique new fruit trees per biome, however bear in mind they do not differ nutrition-wise from one another - which is partly the reason why we decided to biome lock them. We also didn’t want to flood your farming menus with 12 different fruit trees that yield pretty much the same, but reskinned, item. This has all been done with the ease of use in mind.<br />
A new ability to plow soil has also been introduced once you meet the designated research. Plowing soil boosts its fertility to that of Rich soil, however when the plant is harvested, tilled soil returns to its previous form and needs to be plowed again.<br />
This mod has built in patches for Vanilla Cooking Expanded, adding new functionality, such as new condiment recipes!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2102143149">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Props and Decor</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Props and Decor is a major mod release that has been in production for almost 8 months. The main aim is to provide much needed customizability to your bases and cities, a way to add some detail to your rooms and buildings, and to generally allow you to place more of “you” inside the game.<br />
This mod adds almost 350 hand drawn, vanilla-like props, spread across several categories, from place-able filth to space ships. All these props have no functionality in the game - a sink prop doesn’t use Dubs Bad Hygiene, a shelf prop isn’t an actual shelf, and it doesn’t need Deep Storage to work. All these props are simply decorations, and to reward players for placing them, they each provide 1 Beauty - which means they slightly level the beauty rating of the room they are in.<br />
Why didn’t we add functionality to these props? Because of the sheer amount of them - I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t add function to ALL of them. I wouldn’t be satisfied with just 30 props with functions while the rest would just be props. I have then decided all of those should be simply props, as the name of the mod suggests.<br />
Well don’t wait any longer, download this mod, use the new props to decorate your base and make sure to tell your friends about it too! Everyone wants to place a puddle of vomit in their hospitals!</p>

<p>Vanilla power generation is somewhat lackluster late game - Not only the game strongly encourages the use of solar panels and wind turbines as they provide significantly more energy at the cost of no fuel, but it also stops there - there is no technological progression in regards to power. Whether you’re an early industrial colony, or a spacer super-empire (and we all like to roleplay different ways), you’re bound to use the same power sources.<br />
Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power module adds a plethora of new power sources, ranging all the way from small portable generators and large scale industrial ones, all the way to advanced spacer-tech green energy sources and a unique, and yet easy to understand nuclear generator. A selection of new batteries will help you with storing the power, whist the new utilities like a lightning rod and chemfuel pump will give you brand new ways of obtaining power and fuel.<br />
A new, vanilla-fitting energy chain has been added in the form of helixien gas - a combustible substance found mostly on the planets on the galaxy rim. It can be used to power a vast array of new gas-operated structures, making them completely immune from solar flares! Helixien gas can be stored in gas tanks for later use, uses a gas pipe system for connecting to structures and can easily be turned into electricity using gas-operated generators!</p>

<p>Vanilla Armour Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Apparel Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.<br />
Armor is spread across several new technologies that need to be researched which in turn adds valuable game time before you achieve everything there is to achieve. New items cover all technological eras, from wooden armours of neolithic tribes, through chainmails and chestplates of medieval kingdoms, bulletproof vests and ghillie suits of the modern era combat all the way to two, brand new variants of a regular marine armor - one of them with an integrated ranged shield belt!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989352844">Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.<br />
Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.<br />
Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2329126791">Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy Weapons</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk</h5>

<p>What I think this game was missing from the usual combat encounters is a punch, a smell of freshly fired bolters, the heat of an autocannon barrel and the look of surprise on the enemy faces as 10 homing missiles decimate their ranks. Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy is our response to that task: This mod adds incredibly heavy weapons that can only be equipped on a handful of pawns - be it power armored troopers, pawns with a Tough trait or soldiers wearing our new industrial tech exosuits.<br />
These weapons utilise the limited-use code, just like vanilla triple rocket launcher, except they can be fired more than once. After the weapon depletes, it breaks, which means you need to simply craft a new one. No ammo system, nothing like that!<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2194472657">Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Grenades</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>With a brand new utility item code introduced in RimWorld 1.2 update, I saw it as a perfect fit to make grenades be actually useful instead of forcing you to choose between a grenade and a rifle. By crafting grenade belts, you can now equip all vanilla and vanilla expanded grenade types on your pawn alongside any weapon you wish, and use them manually by selecting a special “throw grenade” button on the menu, next to the draft button.<br />
You heard it right, now you can launch grenades and continue to fire your assault carbine at your enemies! No need to call out that single useless colonist that always carries just grenades.<br />
What’s the drawback? Grenades on the belt are limited, much like the ammo for the Grenadier suit in Royalty DLC, you now need to refill the grenades after the charges deplete. You refill them using the grenade type they are made out of - Frag grenade belt gets refilled with frag grenades etc.<br />
Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days. This mod has built in support for other Vanilla Expanded grenades - VWE smoke, flash and gas grenades as well as dynamite from VFE - Settlers!</p>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.<br />
Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.<br />

<p><size=18>Compatible with Version 1.0-1.3</size><br />
<size=18>Features</size><br />
Haulers will check for an existing stack to add it's item to.<br />
Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.<br />
<size=18>Issues</size><br />
You may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen under the following conditions:<br />
there are no existing stacks,<br />
the existing stacks are full<br />
Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue.<br />
<size=18>Conflicts</size><br />
Mods that add special containers might conflict with this mod.  If you have a problem, typically the 'standing' bug please remove the mod and try to provide information on the issue in the workshop thread.<br />
This mod should be compatible with most other mods but let me know if you have any problems.<br />

<p><b>Opportunistic hauling; haul-to-inventory improvements (if <i>Pick Up And Haul</i> is installed).</b><br />
A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.The following description is for RimWorld <b>1.3</b>.<br />
Recognizing this mod: "on the way to", "closer to", "Efficiently unloading".<br />
80% of this mod is improving <color=grey><b>Pick Up And Haul</b></color> (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.<br />
"But my pawns are walking farther!"<br />
Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a <i>much</i> longer journey next time.<br />
<color=teal><i>Pick Up And Haul+</i>: Better unloading</color><br />
We enhance all inventory hauling by unloading only once at each storage destination, in closest order.<br />
We improve performance by caching haulable destinations.<br />
<color=teal>Opportunistic hauls</color><br />
Vanilla has support for opportunities, but with limitations: haulable near your <b>start</b> position, and storage near your job.<br />
We prefer these, but drop them as requirements to include hauls along the path.<br />
We skip opportunities when bleeding or forming a caravan.<br />
<i>Pick Up And Haul+</i><br />
Modified to grab only surrounding things whose unload path is also opportunistic.<br />
<color=teal>Haul extra supplies &amp; ingredients closer</color><br />
If hauling resources to storage would bring them closer to their job, do that first (grabbing extra).<br />
<i>Pick Up And Haul+</i><br />
Modified to grab extra things headed to the same storage (when higher priority).<br />
Grab extra supplies &amp; ingredients headed to the same storage (when equal priority).<br />
