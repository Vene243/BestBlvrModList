<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962">HugsLib</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>HugsLib is a library that provides shared functionality to other mods.<br />
Version: 9.0.0</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552">Hospitality</a> by Orion</h5>

<p>Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. <br />
You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.<br />
Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.<br />
So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. I also need a log. You create it by pressing Ctrl-F12 after you get an error or the problem first occurs. You'll get a link that you can post with your description. <br />
Hospitality should be loaded as late as possible in the load order.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1888705256">Vanilla Hair Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan,  erdelf</h5>

<p>We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.<br />
We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!<br />
And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1446523594">Dubs Mint Menus</a> by Dubwise</h5>

<p>Adds new list boxes for recipe bills, health bills, plant selection, architect menu, research menu, and a quick select menu for designators, making it easier to find things when lots of mods are running.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1938420742">Vanilla Events Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Kikohi,  Helixien</h5>

<p>Vanilla Events Expanded adds several new events to the game, all in line with vanilla events - nothing too drastic. A new tier of events is added - Purple events. Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485">Allow Tool</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 3.11.1<br />
A set of tools to make your life on the Rim a bit easier.<br />
Easily forbid and unforbid items, select similar things, have things hauled urgently and affect the entire map with powerful new tool extensions.<br />
All tools are found in the Architect > Orders menu. Right-click tools with the small mouse icon to access their special context actions.<br />
Pressing the Context Action key ("Equals" by default) will activate the first right-click menu action of the tool you are holding. <br />
All tools are accessible from anywhere by pressing their shortcut key without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=872762753">MinifyEverything</a> by erdelf</h5>

<p>You want to minify every building ? Well then you came to the right place <br />
This mod searches the entire database of buildings and adds the minifiable feature to it.<br />
Should work with pretty much every mod.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761315214">Map Reroll</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 2.7.0<br />
<size=20>Description</size><br />
Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.<br />
Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.<br />
<size=20>How to use</size><br />
Start a new game, or settle a new map. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.<br />
Use "Reroll Map" to pick a new map from a list of previews, or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.<br />
Each page of previews and geyser reroll operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.<br />
The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options > Mod Settings menu.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718191613">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical Module</a> by OskarPotocki,  Atlas,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical module adds several new pieces of furniture to allow players for higher variety of medical beds and linkables. Sterile walls have also been added with color-coded line markings, allowing users to color-code the rooms.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1319782555">Snap Out!</a> by Weilbyte</h5>

<p>Gives your pawns the ability to try calm down a pawn in a mental break. </p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013">Vanilla Expanded Framework</a> by Oskar Potocki,  XeoNovaDan,  Orion,  Kikohi,  Taranchuk,  Sarg Bjornson,  Erdelf</h5>

<p>Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.<br />
Orion's Faction Discovery?<br />
Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1814383360">Vanilla Weapons Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Trunken,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.<br />
Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2028381079">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer Module</a> by OskarPotocki,  Atlas,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer module adds several new pieces of furniture to allow players to witness better technological progress in regards to comfort and utility furniture. Repair shelves, Biolab sunlamps and reinforced walls will spice your colony up, whilst illuminated dressers and end tables as well as advanced beds will provide your pawns with highest possible comfort silver can buy.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1957158779">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming</a> by Oskar Potocki,  dninemfive,  Kikohi</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.<br />
A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe it’s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!<br />
New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1968134023">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art module is something long overdue. Being an artist, I struggled to comprehend why the only type of sculptures we can make are small, large or grand artworks on a tiny pedestal. It made Artistic skill pretty much undesirable. Come on, how many times have you said to yourself “Oh crikey, that’s another pawn that can only do art”? <br />
A lot of people requested this mod on my Patreon so it’s about time I deliver. With this mod, your colony can create simple pottery from neolithic times, allowing you to gain some silver on the side to kickstart your base into the medieval era. Several new pieces of sculptures are available by the likes of small, large and grand statues, wall reliefs, decorative pillars and plinths that act both as an artwork and a shelf.<br />
With industrial era your colony will be able to produce beautiful embroidered rugs to decorate those ugly floors! A new type of wall - wallpaper - is now also available, allowing you to put some colour onto your grim, broken walls. Spacer era features a new type of art called a hologram, emitting beautiful shade of blue light and using intellectual skill to determine the quality of it - however it does use up power!<br />
And if that isn’t enough, a new type of quest reward is available - Archotech sculptures, not only being extremely beautiful and desirable, but also imprinting stunning imagery in the minds of surrounding colonists!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914064942">Vanilla Fishing Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.<br />
With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.<br />
<size=24>Compatibility</size><br />
Compatible with any other fishing mod<br />
Compatible with Advanced Biomes<br />
Compatible with Realistic Planets<br />
Compatible with Nature's Pretty Sweet<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1906780517">Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw is an addition to a popular Vanilla Expanded mod series, adding four new quickdraw weapons. These firearms allow you to quickly respond to sudden enemy encounters, as special plasteel alloys allow you to reduce the aiming time to zero. There are drawbacks however - whilst these weapons fire a little bit faster than their vanilla counterparts, the cooldown after firing the shots is slightly increased.<br />
Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907283935">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tropical Swamp</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Tropical swamp never really had this “oh, this zone is dangerous” feel. It felt just like any other swamp. This very module, albeit only adding 3 new animals, is our way to remedy this. Alligators and Anacondas will now actively hunt in the tropical swamp biome, and they are a force to be reckoned with. To ease things up, we have also added Indian elephants - smaller versions of their african counterparts, with no tusks that can be sold. They are significantly easier to hunt and tame, and are a useful pack animal.<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Swamp biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Swamp, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907283872">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tropical Rainforest</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>After having my first Spaceship launch in the tropical rainforest biome, I have noticed it actually didn’t feel as tropical as I would like it to feel. Monkeys, tortoises, an elephant here and there, it doesn’t really give away that unique, diverse environment vibe. Sarg and I have decided to expand on it with a range of new, unique animals, which include gorillas and mandrills - possibly the most “jungle” animals there are. It is absolutely possible to tame your own army of tigers and send them off to hunt down the enemies, just as it is possible to have a peaceful tapir farm on the outskirts of the jungle!<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Rainforest biome expansion. It adds 6 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Rainforest, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845154007">Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Trunken,  XeoNovaDan</h5>

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. <br />
This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1617282896">LWM's Deep Storage</a> by Little White Mouse</h5>

<p>Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution<br />
LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!<br />
ADDON MODS:<br />
* Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:<br />
* A (faster?) UI for right-clicking on things: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018<br />
* Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!<br />
FAQ / "I have a problem":<br />
* Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!<br />
* These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric<br />
* Does it work with Vanilla shelves?<br />
* You can always add more stored things in Mod Settings<br />
<em>* (A little walkthrough for doing that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187075071)<br />
Want to say Thanks?<br />
* Have *</em> in Art?  Draw me a picture of a little white mouse!  I'm reachable on the Ludeon forum.<br />
* Have extra spending money?  Share a cup of something tasty (some places around here deliver!) at https://ko-fi.com/littlewhitemouse<br />
Notes:<br />
* Storing things properly takes time - the colonists must carefully organize everything so it's easy to find what's needed.(<em>)<br />
* Animals cannot by default haul to Storage - their little brains and paws (claws, etc) cannot manage the clasps, locks, catches, etc required to store things properly.(</em>)<br />
* All the units you can build are in the Storage menu - by default this includes other mods' storage buildings.(<em>)<br />
* (</em>) - these can be changed in the Mod Settings (again, link above)<br />
Compatibility:<br />
* Storage compatible with many different mods: Dubs Bad Hygiene, RimCuisine, Survival Tools, Vegetable Garden.  If you see something that SHOULD be stored but isn't?  You can let me know!<br />
* You can also change what's allowed in the Mod Settings!<br />
* Plays well with mods that change stack size (OgreStack, Deep Stack, etc).  Want 10 stacks of 1000 Advanced Components in one square?  Go for it!  (Just watch out for mortar attacks...)<br />
* Plays well with mods that affect storage: Restricted Storage (LWM), Satisfied Storage, RimWorld Search Agency (not as well as Satisfied Storage), Stockpile for Disaster, heck - there's a Deep Refrigerator if you play with RimFridge<br />
* Plays well with mods that affect hauling: CommonSense, Pick Up and Haul.<br />
* Haul To Stack?  I have conflicting reports, let me know.<br />
* Other storage mods? maybe:<br />
<em>* Project RimFactory: probably okay, should be fully compatible soon<br />
*</em> Extended Storage: maybe<br />
** Other storage mod???  If you get weird behavior, turn off "Over Capacity" check in mod settings<br />
* Industrial Rollers: not fully, but fix is coming!<br />
Want more types of units?  Frozen organ storage?  Piggy banks for silver?  Cubbyholes for bedrolls?  You can either make your own derived mod (the XML is a mess, but it's a documented mess, and it's easy enough to follow!) or you can suggest things to me and offer to acquire a graphic (draw it yourself, find a free one, make deals with demons, whatever).<br />
Translations:<br />
Русский - Тхакиро<br />
Deutsch - Erdnussbrot<br />
Chinese Traditional - shiuanyue<br />
Note on Translations: These may not be complete translations, as I do add things from time to time. Want to translate it (all or part) into your language?  Great!  Let me know, I'll add it to the mod (or do a Pull Request on GitHub, if you do that thing - that is easiest for me!)<br />
The code can be found online at: https://github.com/lilwhitemouse/RimWorld-LWM.DeepStorage<br />

Almost all code (c) LWM, released under LGPL, because I think that the LGPL is the license we should actually be using for mods.  Not that anyone is likely to complain if we use something else, but altho we have a stupid copyright system, we should still use it correctly.<br />
Thanks to Marnador for the RimWorld font.  Thanks to Pardeike for Harmony.  Awesome.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134308519">Vanilla Cooking Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson,  Chowder</h5>

<p>Vanilla Cooking Expanded is a core module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods work very well without it, Vanilla Cooking Expanded makes use of fish from Vanilla Fishing Expanded as well as plants from Vanilla Plants Expanded in order to provide users with a more in-depth cooking experience.<br />
Mechanics are simple and intuitive - keeping within the vanilla spirit without the unnecessary fluff and production chains. Your colonists will be able to cook up a variety of new meal types, make mood boosting desserts out of fruits, make filling grilled meals that lose the effect when frozen, create large bakes using flour or produce large quantities of soup through boiling ingredients for several days at a time. Using our new system, you can now transform animal milk into cheese inside a cheese press - and it gains quality, and with that - value, the longer it’s inside! Yes, alongside Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval you can now create a cheese and wine empire! Hopefully this will provide one more reason to keep livestock!<br />
Our systems are heavily moddable and support a variety of pre-existing mods. With Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids you can now transform insectoid milk into insectoid cheese, and thanks to Sarg Bjornson, you can now utilise 19 (!) types of milk from Alpha Animals, Genetic Rim (plus patches), RimBees and Forsakens: Fauna to create your cheese empire!<br />
New ways of preserving food in the form of canning and deep frying, as well as a brand new condiment system will allow you to create not-so-filling gourmet meals that apply long term effects to people who consume them.</p>

<p>Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.<br />
This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.<br />
When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.<br />
We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!</p>

<p>No animal mod, or in this instance, mod series, can be complete without Lions. This mod, albeit being smaller to not overpopulate the desolate deserts of the planet, contains some of the most popular and requested - and dangerous - animals that can most often be found in the desert. With this particular mod you can hear hyena’s laughter echo through the night, train your own pack of lions, tackle a desert tortoise and die due to venom injected by the feared gila monster.<br />
Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Desert biome expansion. It adds 4 new animals that will spawn in the Desert, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895364585">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tundra</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Tundra biome always felt devoid of any actual unique animals. With this module, we have introduced Musk oxen and a moose - a beautiful symbol of Canada, which can be milked every couple of days just like an already existing in the game Elk. Porcupines are tiny rodents, similar in a lot of ways to Capybaras, with sharp quills used to repel predators. Beware of the Megawolverines though! They are genetically modified experiment out of control, by many described as just large balls of fur and claws. Taming one could be a challenge, but having one ready for combat is a huge advantage.<br />

<p>Australia is currently suffering a terrible crisis, and our team believes that we need to do everything in our power to spread the awareness. 24 people have died due to the insane bushfires so far - with three of them being volunteer firefighters. Over 6.3 million hectares of land have been burnt, leading to deaths of countless animals - some native only to the continent of Australia. You probably wonder how big is the 6.3 million hectares? Well, it’s essentially half of England. Please, consider donating to either NSW Rural Fire Service or WWF (both links will be available at the bottom of the mod description) to help save what little animals are still alive.<br />

<p>Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Cats and Dogs variant. This mod adds 21 new breeds of dogs and cats to perfectly fit vanilla game, with custom vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing. With this variant you are finally able to send your maine coons on the enemies, run a farm with an old german shepherd or run a dog show with all your sweet poodles.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1836900626">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Arid Shrubland</a> by Oskar Potocki</h5>

<p>A giraffe is probably the most recognizable african animal. For some reason, it’s not in the vanilla base game, and your african tribe immersion is forever ruined. Crocodiles can never hunt you around the river bank, hippopotami can’t rip your arms off with a single bite and you can’t hear coyotes around the campfires. Except, now you can.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895364938">Vanilla Animals Expanded — Boreal Forest</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Boreal forest is a biome drastically needing some new, unique animals. With this module, you can see famous american black bears - smaller cousins of the grizzly bears, as well as arctic coyotes and tiny otters.<br />

<p>I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2493234474">Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations</a> by Sarg Bjornson</h5>

<p>Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations is a standalone release in the Vanilla Textures Expanded series, aiming at providing a LOT of visual variety to your vanilla bases.<br />
So, what does it do? Basically, it provides building graphics variations for the majority of vanilla’s buildings. This means every time you build a chair, the chair will have a randomized graphics. Not only that, but you can also swap the graphic of the building on command, allowing you to mix and match styles to properly decorate your base.<br />
The mod includes more than 150 new random building graphics for 35 vanilla buildings.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2439736083">Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk</h5>

<p>Vanilla Social Interactions Expanded means to bring much more needed life to your pawns as well as the overall world map. This mod alters what pawns do in their spare time, adds some much needed content in regards to interactions that breathes fresh air into otherwise boring and stale game. Pawns now also have aspirations that can be fulfilled to gain powerful mood buffs, and the whole inspiration system is also changed.<br />
Each of the mechanics in this mod can be disabled in mod options.<br />
This mod adds following mechanics:<br />
- Memories<br />
- Inspiration Changes<br />
- Obtaining New traits<br />
- Venting<br />

<p>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.<br />

<p>Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.<br />
Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?<br />
This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:<br />
Gas masks protecting from toxicity;<br />
Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;<br />
Doctor scrubs and Chef’s uniforms.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2296404655">Vanilla Traits Expanded</a> by Oskar Potocki,  Taranchuk,  Chowder</h5>

<p>Have you ever thought about how base game traits become repetitive after a while? Are you tired of seeing pyromaniac or kind pawn over and over again? Are you perhaps considering pyromaniac to be an instant death sentence in your colony? If for any of these questions the answer was ‘aye’, then look no further.<br />
Vanilla Traits Expanded adds 55 new traits, some offering unique new game mechanics, some being quirky and enhancing the storytelling, and some being straight up stat upgrades. Traits’ commonality has been adjusted after weeks of testing, to make sure no powerful or annoying traits appear too often.<br />
Using our new mod options menu, you can now disable specific traits added by vanilla game or any of the mods you have. This doesn’t mean that the trait will be magically removed from the pawn, but it’s commonality will be reduced to 0, stopping it from ever appearing in the game again.<br />
I really hope you will enjoy the effect of our hard work! Let us know in the comments what you think works and what doesn’t!</p>

<p>After the success of our Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval, which was a faction mod closing the gap between tribal faction and outlander faction, we have begun work on another faction mod - this time adding frontier settlers, inspired by western films. The scope of this mod is quite similar to our Medieval mod, so you can expect it to be a well fitting mini-expansion.<br />
Thanks to Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers, you can experience the harsh reality of being a gang of bandits on the rimworld frontier. Settlements of this faction are built in the same way they were in frontier America - with a main road separating a town into two parts. Thanks to new outfits and headgear, as well as several new weapons, your colonists will be able to blend in perfectly alongside all those thugs and prospectors shooting each other on the streets and drinking chemshine - a new, highly volatile chemfuel distilled alcohol. A large amount of new chemfuel-themed structures allow you to witness the power of combustible fuel, making your bases look just like the wild west settlements! A new starting scenario allows you to play bandits, a faction hostile to every other civilisation on the planet, and with new world quests you can become a bounty hunter or a caravan raider! Sorry, no stagecoach robbery included!<br />
A new storyteller, Diego Dire, would like to tell you a story that begins with the blaze of glory. Not only will he provide you with more western-style events than regular, vanilla events, he will also scale backwards - meaning the beginning will be difficult, but it will slowly become more and more friendly. That is, of course, until Diego decides to start the cycle all over again, throwing the worst of the worst at you. Can you handle the challenge?<br />
With a native support for the other Vanilla Expanded mods, settlers will come equipped with Vanilla Apparel Expanded clothing, whilst thanks to Vanilla Weapons Expanded, bandits will start using lever action rifles and sawed-off shotguns!<br />
And watch out for drunk muffalos. Those beasts love chemshine!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730936602">Achtung!</a> by Andreas Pardeike</h5>

<p>Command your colonists like a boss!<br />
The Achtung! mod enhances how you control RimWorld. You will get more control on how to position your colonists and how they take job orders.<br />
In a nutshell you can:<br />
- position your drafted colonists along a line<br />
- move them in formation<br />
- give orders to multiple colonists at once<br />
- force jobs so they get uninterrupted attention<br />
- haul and repair outside allowed areas<br />
EXAMPLES<br />
(<em>) Save time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose "melee". Done.<br />
(</em>) In combat, position colonists equally spaced in door openings. Select multiple drafted colonists and with the right mouse button drag a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!<br />
(<em>) Fall back a few steps with a group of colonists? Easy. Select them and hold the configured key to move them relative to their current formation. You can even rotate the formation with the standard rotation keys.<br />
(</em>) Make sure that wall and the sandbags are build before the raid arrives. No cloudwatching or eating allowed! Use the [Force] button that Achtung! adds to all "Prioritize..." menus and you can be sure that all assigned work will be done.<br />
(<em>) Want one colonist harvest and another sow these three fields? Force them to their tasks and queue up non-adjacted fields by simply adding forced work on them (like ordinary jobs but without the shift key).<br />
(</em>) Treat all injured colonists in their beds? Select a doctor, choose "Prioritize tending... [Force]" and increase the search range so nearby patients will be included (you will see a small "!" on all forced job). Then focus on other important stuff because you can be sure it's done.<br />
The original three Achtung! commands "Clean Room", "Fight Fire" or "Sow Zone/Room" still exist because they do stuff a bit smarter than the build in prioritized work commands.<br />
SETTINGS<br />
Achtung uses the default way to access mod settings. There, you find switches to turn certain features on/off and you can change the default keys to your liking.<br />
ADDING AND REMOVING:<br />
Achtung can be added to any existing game. It usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will "clean" the save and remove the dependency.<br />
